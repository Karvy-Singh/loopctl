# loopctl
Repeat a media/section of media "x" number of times on Linux.

## WHY??
Well, sometimes we (i do) may find ourselves in scenarios wherein i want to play a song lets say two times before switching to next one in my playist, and some players provide either repeat once or forever without custom repeat numbers/ some provide no option to repeat.

Also most players don't allow to repeat a certain part of media, example in case of a 8 min if i want to hear a certain 1-2 min again, another one dance teachers wanting to teach on a certain part of song.

OR any other use case it may be useful to you as a tool.
